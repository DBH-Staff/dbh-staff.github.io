If you slip up we will give you multiple chances so you learn from your mistakes.</h3>
<p>Here are some rules that you are supposed to follow ↓</p>
<p>𝟭. Respect. Shouldn&rsquo;t be to hard to follow. Respect everyone equally.</p>
<p>𝟮.Follow <a href="https://discord.com/channels/639477525927690240/898041835002400768/898233552334897204"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >📜╏rules</a> as well as these. You are still a member inside this community so you are not immune.</p>
<p>𝟯. Don&rsquo;t be bias towards people. Falls under respect at the end of the day.</p>
<p>𝟰. Be polite. When talking in chats we allow you to have fun and have a laugh with everyone. But still be polite 😀 .</p>
<p>𝟱. If someone asks you a question, be sure to answer it. This could be in a second, minute or even an hour. Just give a response. And if you don&rsquo;t know an answer to the question kindly say you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>𝟲. If you don&rsquo;t know the answer to a ticket, don&rsquo;t answer/ chat in the channel unless you are giving an update on something you have had confirmation on.</p>
<p>𝟳. Common sense. Self explanatory.</p>
<p>𝟴. Don&rsquo;t abuse your power, will get automatically demoted if caught doing this.</p>
<p>𝟵. Inform other staff members if you find any problems/ unsure of a problem or punishment. We all make mistakes if you make one, it&rsquo;s all good, apologise and undo the punishment (if it&rsquo;s a ban contact a staff member with ban perms.) Use team work!</p>
<p>𝟭𝟬. Punishment logs, all staff are required to post proof ( <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/949604552779390976/968414011198685234/Screenshot_20220426-130124_Discord.png"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" >🧰╏proof</a> ). If you don&rsquo;t you will get warnings which may result in a demotion.</p>
<p>Overall message:</p>
<h4 id="be-nice-have-fun-and-most-importantly-serve-dan-to-the-best-of-your-ability">Be nice, have fun, and most importantly serve Dan to the best of your ability.</h4>
